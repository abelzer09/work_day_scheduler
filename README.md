# work_day_scheduler

In this assigment I was tasked with modifying existing starter code for  a work day scheuler that would utilize moments js along with jquery fontawesom and bootstap to create a finshed product.

I was unable to complete every all requirements as I could not figure out how to get the data saved in local storage to render after page was refreshed before deadline.
